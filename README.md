## Hackathon project <br>
What this project is about: <p>
The ultimate stop for all the competitive coders! Much like a dashboard for competitive coding, it displays the statistics for all the competitive programming sites that an user may have signed up for, and has participation in.<br>
Most of the time, when people tend to showcase their achievements, they tend to clutter their resumes and other profiles like linkedin & github profile readme-s with multiple links- checking all of them at once may be cumbersome for the people who are viewing their profiles as they have to open each link everytime they want to see the statistics. With the help of this website however, the viewer can view only the statistics of all the profiles set by the user. </p>
- Has a simple interface, with the statistics of the coding website profile details of the user <br>
- The user can choose the number of profiles they want to display in their dashboard <br>
- Privacy is maintained as no sensitive information is leaked, just the competitive programming profile username is shown along with the statistics.
